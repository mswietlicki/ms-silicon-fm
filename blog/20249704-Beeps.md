# Playing sounds from MCU 

SA828 has PA and speaker output and it outputs FM transitions. I would like to be able to play beeps or even some audio clips from MCU on power on/off, volume up/down, etc. I would also like to use the same volume control as SA828.

SA828 disables speaker when no RX signal is detected, thankfully the is SPKEN pin that design to read if there is incoming signal but we can use it also as an enable speaker input.

**I connected MCU pin 26 to SA828 pin 16 and MCU pin 27 to SA828 SPKEN pin.** and them play some PWN beeps.

```python
# Init
speakerPin = Pin(26, Pin.OPEN_DRAIN, None, value=1)
speakerEnable = Pin(27, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)
speakerPWN = PWM(speakerPin)
speakerPin.init(Pin.OPEN_DRAIN, value=1)

# Play
speakerEnable.init(mode=Pin.OUT, value=1)
speakerPin.init(Pin.ALT, alt = Pin.ALT_PWM)
speakerPWN.init(duty_u16=1000, duty_ns=15252, freq=1000)

sleep(1)

# Stop and free audio pin
speakerEnable.init(Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_DOWN)
speakerPWN.deinit()
speakerPin.init(Pin.OPEN_DRAIN, value=1)
```
