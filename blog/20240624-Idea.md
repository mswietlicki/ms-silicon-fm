# Idea

We were kite surfing in Jastarnia (Hel) with rented equipment. During stay in Kateing school I noticed that they use PMR walkie-talkies (Motorola Talkabout T82 Extreme) and have number of problems with them.

1. Heavy 200g (needs to be connect the student helmet)
2. IPx4 (require plastic bag for water use)
3. Default 8 or even extended 16 PMR channels are a problem during High Season with 100+ students on the water

Idea is to use SA828-U FM radio module and transparent silicon to create very waterproof and lightweight FM radio for use by students on the water and ideally also by instructors on the shore.

## MVP

1. Fully closed silicon blob
2. Power button inside silicon
3. Speaker
4. Power LED
5. Some kind of USB connector for programming
6. No TX, not Volume control, no channel control. All would be set during programming.
   
## Stretch goals

1. TX support
2. Volume buttons
3. Channel control (maybe the same buttons as Volume)
4. Voice responses
5. SOS feature
6. Low power indicator
7. Replaceable battery
8. more ?
